# Reflect - Daily Journal App with Gemini LLM

Reflect is a private, cloud-based journal where users speak or type daily reflections. The app uses Gemini LLM to summarize, reflect, and generate positive prompts or suggestions.

## Features

- **Speech-to-Text Input**: Record your thoughts by speaking into the app
- **Text Input + Editing**: Type or edit entries manually
- **LLM-Powered Insights**: Summaries, mood detection, and reflections generated by Gemini
- **Daily Prompts**: AI-generated personalized writing prompts
- **Mood Tracking**: Visualize your emotional patterns over time
- **Secure Cloud Storage**: All entries securely stored (placeholder for cloud integration)

## Tech Stack

- React with TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Google Cloud Platform integration:
  - Firebase Auth (placeholder)
  - Firestore (placeholder)
  - Google Cloud Speech-to-Text (placeholder)
  - Gemini API (placeholder)

## Development

This application is currently an MVP front-end implementation with placeholder functions for cloud services. To make it fully functional, the placeholder API functions in `src/utils/apiUtils.ts` would need to be connected to actual Google Cloud Platform services.

## Getting Started

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

## Future Enhancements

- Implement actual GCP service connections
- Add user authentication and multi-user support
- Create mobile apps using React Native or Flutter
- Add data visualization for longer-term mood tracking
- Implement multi-language support

## Privacy & Security

In a production implementation, this application would include:
- Encrypted storage of journal entries
- OAuth2-based authentication
- Server-side LLM processing to protect user data
